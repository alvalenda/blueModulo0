\nI've waited here for you\
\nEverlong\
\n\nTonight, I throw myself into\
\nAnd out of the red\nOut of her head, she sang\
\n\nCome down and waste away with me\
\nDown with me\
\nSlow, how you wanted it to be\
\nI'm over my head\
\nOut of her head, she sang\
\n\nAnd I wonder\
\nWhen I sing along with you\
\n\nIf everything could ever be this real forever\
\nIf anything could ever be this good again\
\nThe only thing I'll ever ask of you\
\nYou've got to promise not to stop when I say when\
\nShe sang\
\n\nBreathe out\
\nSo I can breathe you in\
\nHold you in\
\nAnd now\
\nI know you've always been\
\nOut of your head\
\nOut of my head, I sang\
\n\nAnd I wonder\
\nWhen I sing along with you\
\n\nIf everything could ever feel this real forever\
\nIf anything could ever be this good again\
\nThe only thing I'll ever ask of you\
\nYou've got to promise not to stop when I say when\
\nShe sang\
\n\nAnd I wonder\
\n\nIf everything could ever feel this real forever\
\nIf anything could ever be this good again\
\nThe only thing I'll ever ask of you\
\nYou've got to promise not to stop when I say when.";
